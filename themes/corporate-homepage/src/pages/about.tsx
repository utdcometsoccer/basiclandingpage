            <p>
              We are a Microsoft shop developing solutions with SharePoint,
              Azure, .NET, and TypeScript, but we have come to the realization
              that the technology is basically irrelevant if the solution
              doesn't do what the customer needs. My partner and I have had
              relatively long careers in IT and suffered through multiple
              project failures, layoffs, long travel, and so many grumpy bosses.
              We've learned a few things along the way.
            </p>
            <h2>Projects don't fail for lack of skill</h2>
            <p>
              Projects fail for so many reasons, but ultimately projects and
              software doesn't need to be sexy to succeed. The most necessary
              ingredients for success are clear goals and a realistic plan for
              delivering the client's goals.
            </p>
            <h2>Projects can fail even when they succeed</h2>
            <p>
              Often times, a team can deliver exactly what was promised, the
              project owner can be estatic about the results, and the project
              can still be a colossal flop that kills the company who started
              it.
            </p>
            <h2>Clients spend too much time worrying about buzzwords</h2>
            <p>
              IT Departments so often latch onto the latest technology or the
              latest buzzword and decide that "We must have{" "}
              <Emphasis>this</Emphasis>." We believe that more important than
              the latest sexy resume stuffer, or the sexiest AI technology, is
              remembering why you want that thing -{" "}
              <Emphasis>the problem you are solving.</Emphasis>
            </p>
            <h2>The Light bulb moment</h2>
            <p>
              There was a particular moment that brought all of this home for me
              the hardest - I had just been laid off 5 days before closing a
              deal to buy a charming home in downtown Grand Junction, CO. I
              needed work desperately and a former co-worker kindly offered me
              some. If I am honest, the project gave me misgivings and I wasn't
              in the meetings with the client so I got all the requirements
              secondhand. The project failed. Looking back, I wouldn't ever do a
              project like that again and no one was happy with the outcome. The
              critical take away from that project over all is that I needed to
              own the client relationship and make sure everyone agrees on the
              value being delivered. We deliver.
            </p>
            <h2>Who do we work with?</h2>
            <p>
              We do not work with clients who we do not believe we can provide
              value to. Trident Professional Services's goal, our mission is to
              see your business or organization grow. In order to do that we are
              going to seek to establish a strong working relationship with our
              clients. So if we chose to work with you it isn't just that we
              want your money - it is because we believe in you and your
              organization and we want to see you succeed. We think you are
              special.
            </p>
            <h2>What We Do and Don't do</h2>
            <p>
              We don't do projects. We don't treat our consultants as
              interchangeable machines. We do <Emphasis>products</Emphasis>. We
              establish long lasting relationships with our clients and
              collaborate on products to deliver clearly established value. We
              adopt technology: the cloud, JAMStack, AI, etc only when we can
              clearly establish the value to our clients.
