Album Header:

```jsx
<AlbumHeader contactNavigation={[{children:"Follow on Twitter"},{children:"Like on Facebook"},{children:"Email me"}]}>
Add some information about the album below, the author, or any
                other background context. Make it a few sentences long so folks
                can pick up some informative tidbits. Then, link them off to
                some social networking sites or contact information.
